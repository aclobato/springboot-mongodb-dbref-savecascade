# springboot-mongodb-dbref-savecascade

Test project for cascading DBRef objects saving in Spring Data MongoDB, based on the article [Spring Data MongoDB cascade save on DBRef objects](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/11/spring-data-mongodb-cascade-save-on-dbref-objects.html) from Maciej Walkowiak.

The difference in relation to the code presented in the article is in the ability to save objects that are in a list.
